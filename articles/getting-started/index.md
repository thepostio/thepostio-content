*Disclaimer:* **ThePost** is just at the beginning of its development; bugs may happen, display may be a bit odd.  

# What is ThePost?
**ThePost**, found at `thepost.io`, can be seen as a blog engine, but it's more subtle than that.  
It's a publishing playground where the authors keep full control and ownership of their work. **How?** Simple, we don't store your content, actually, we don't even cache it!

## What do you mean?
ThePost relies on **Github**, if you publish your articles in a certain ways there, they show up here, with a nice display, nice URL to share, SEO support, etc. Note that ThePost is by no means associated with GitHub, it just uses some of its features.

# How do I make content available on ThePost?
Here is the basics, we'll get into the details later:
1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/thepostio/thepostio-content) (keep the name `thepostio-content`, it's important)
2. Have a look at the structure, you will see it's quite minimalistic
3. Open the file `config.yaml` (in root folder) and replace the values with your own
4. Create a folder in `articles/` for your fist article, using only lowercase letters and dashes instead of spaces. This folder's name will be part of the final URL of your article
5. Create a file `index.md` that contains a YAML front matter
6. Edit the fields of the front matter (between `---` and `---`)
7. Under the second `---`, write your article in markdown syntax
8. Optionaly, if you want this article to show up in your profile page listing, add its folder name in the file `config.yaml` that you can find at the root of this repo
9. Commit and push that on your GitHub repo
10. Visit `https://thepost.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_ARTICLE_TITLE_SLUG`

**Example:** if your username on GitHub is `johnnybravo` and the folder name of your article (lowercase + dashes) is `my-fabulous-article`, then you can see and share your article at:  
`https://thepost.io/johnnybravo/my-fabulous-article`

And here is how the `index.md` file of your article should look like:
```markdown
