title: An Article Has No Cover

excerpt: This is demo of what happens when you choose not to have a cover image on your article

# So what's happening here?
*The Post* does not force you to use a cover image, it's only a general good practice regarding *SEO* and the *card* it creates when you share an article on social media.  

On the article page such as this one, you will notice that no image is beeing used on the background of the title. On the other hand, I still took the decision to show *The Post* generic mosaic on the article [listing page](https://thepost.io/thepostio). The latter is to create a certain harmonization because a listing with some articles having a cover image and other just showing a white rectangle would look a bit odd.  

I hope you're OK with that.
